# subsurf.js

Subsurf.js is a small library for rendering subdivision surfaces on the GPU
with WebGL.  It works by subdividing an input mesh once, decomposing it into
bicubic patches, then rendering said patches on the GPU. 

Right now, the "library" is more of a demo, as I'm unsure what sort of API
would be best.

Contributors welcome.
