# subsurf.js

GPU/WebGL subdivision surface rendering library. It works by subdividing an input mesh 
once, decomposing it into bicubic patches, which it evaluates on the GPU.  It does
this by packing the patch parameters into a texture, then rendering each patch
via (a single) vertex array of 2D u,v points. 

Right now, the "library" is more of a demo, as I'm unsure what sort of API
would be best.

Contributors welcome.
